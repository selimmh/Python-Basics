# to convert numbers to strings, we use str() function

my_name = "selim".title()
my_age = 19

print("Hey " + my_name + ", you are " + str(my_age) + " years old.")

# not using str() will give you error, because
# python needs to know if you enter number '19'
# or two characters '1' and '9'
